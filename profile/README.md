# GRAD-E1487 Causal Machine Learning
#### [Drew Dimmery](https://ddimmery.com), [Hertie School Data Science Lab](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/datasciencelab)

This organization contains all materials for the course Causal Machine Learning.

# Table of Contents

* [**Syllabus**](https://github.com/causalml-fall25/syllabus) This is the canonical version of the syllabus.
* [**Readings**](https://github.com/causalml-fall25/readings) (Note that this is restricted to enrolled students)
* [**Lectures**](https://github.com/causalml-fall25/lecture-slides) I will upload my lecture slides to this repository.
* [**Presentations**](https://github.com/causalml-fall25/presentations) Students will upload their presentations in this repository in pdf format.
* [**Referee Reports**](https://github.com/causalml-fall25/referee-reports) Students will upload their referee reports in this repository in pdf format.

**Demos** and **projects** will be shared by students in individual repositories. Demos should be forkable to classmates (an easy solution is to use the `causalml-fall25` organization to create a repository that all Members of the organization have access to). Projects need only be accessible to the professor, but I would encourage you to [work in public](https://press.stripe.com/working-in-public) and use this as an opportunity to develop your data science portfolio. I have some additional information to get you started on the projects in the [project-info repository](https://github.com/causalml-fall25/project-info) which I will add to as necessary.

Since all of this is on GitHub, I encourage you to submit PRs to the syllabus and lecture repositories if you find mistakes or typos. You can also submit Issues if you need clarification on something particular.

Also note that it is very easy to see what has changed in any repository. For example, to see a list of all changes made to the syllabus, just look at the [log of commits](https://github.com/causalml-fall25/syllabus/commits/main/). For each commit, you can see exactly what was changed, such as [this one where I entered my office hours](https://github.com/causalml-fall25/syllabus/commit/60fc2095a3884fd2435cd2255dbffcadef66facc).
