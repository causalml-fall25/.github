# GRAD-E1487 Causal Machine Learning
#### [Drew Dimmery](https://ddimmery.com), [Hertie School Data Science Lab](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/datasciencelab)

This organization contains all materials for the course Causal Machine Learning.

# Table of Contents

* [**Syllabus**](https://github.com/causalml-fall25/syllabus) This is the canonical version of the syllabus. Note that you can look at the log to see if anything has been changed.
* [**Readings**](https://github.com/causalml-fall25/readings) (Note that this is restricted to enrolled students)
* [**Lectures**](https://github.com/causalml-fall25/lecture-slides) I will upload my lecture slides to this repository.
* [**Presentations**](https://github.com/causalml-fall25/presentations) Students will upload their presentations in this repository in pdf format.
* [**Referee Reports**](https://github.com/causalml-fall25/referee-reports) Students will upload their referee reports in this repository in pdf format.

**Demos** and **projects** will be shared by students in individual repositories. Demos should be forkable to classmates (an easy solution is to use the `causalml-fall25` organization to create a repository that all Members of the organization have access to). Projects need only be accessible to the professor, but I would encourage you to [work in public](https://press.stripe.com/working-in-public) and use this as an opportunity to develop your data science portfolio.

Since all of this is on GitHub, I encourage you to submit PRs to the syllabus and lecture repositories if you find mistakes or typos. You can also submit Issues if you need clarification on something particular.
